-fix potential SIGABRTs due to non-spec use of the mainloop
-mpd attempts to obtain a lock on the mainloop thread before it is started
-considering pa_mainloop_lock's 'pa_assert(!m->thread || !pa_thread_is_running(m->thread) || !in_worker(m))' code, with m->thread == NULL, the resulting false-positive and short-circuit operator || prevents a SIGABRT slightly further down the codepath. i imagine this false-positive 'saviour' being removed some day with the expectation that implementations start the thread before requiring a lock

# PulseOutputPlugin_.avoid.locking.mainloop.object.from.within.mainloop.thread.diff [git sha:9da57e7458ed2e539ba1693ca748c0e5c7969585 | committed]
-fixes regression introduced by: '8d6fedf8177d0d2ced81e6d93d35c368b2ac69db [PATCH] Mixer: add class MixerListener' -listener.OnMixerVolumeChanged() called GetVolume() which attempted to acquire the lock but as per 'pa_threaded_mainloop_lock()' documentation:
This function may not be called inside the event loop thread. Events that are dispatched from the event loop thread are executed with this lock held
-this patch seperates the underlying action of GetVolume() into a new GetVolumeInternal() function, to be called only when the lock is already held, as is the case for the listener.OnMixerVolumeChanged() call
