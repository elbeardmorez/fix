-don't initialise 'with_lispdir' unless the 'compute-lispdir' script is
successful
-hint to the user why the default 'datarootdir' based target changed

-issue hit if local sitepath set in .emacs. the 'compute-lispdir' script 
draws a blank, and so the install-lisp LISP target installs the files to
themselves?!
-ensuring the local sitepath exists in EMACSLOADPATH is an alternative 
work around

-give nesting a chance by removing mix of tabs and spaces

# fix.source.buffer.erroneously.receiving.focus.diff [git sha:4af117924bc8759b1948ae6e6e5b97ad7e0ede55 | committed]

-after running commands from the source buffer (e.g. via Short-Key
mode) the source buffer always receives point focus following a
command, regardless of where that command came from. this makes
executing concurrent commands from the command buffer very tedious

-it appears 'realgud-cmd-remap' is only called when executing
commands from the source buffer, but this function is the only place
where 'in-srcbuf' (which ultimately determines which buffer obtains
focus) is set:

(realgud-cmdbuf-info-in-srcbuf?= (not (realgud-cmdbuf? buffer)))

hence 'in-srcbuf' is only ever set 't' from its initial 'nil' value,
resulting in the behaviour described

-this commit simply resets the 'in-srcbuf' variable at an appropriate
point in the command execution stack
