From Mono.Debugging/Mono.Debugging.Client/DebuggerSession.cs

// Executes one line of code
public void NextLine ()

// Executes one line of code, stepping into method invocations
public void StepLine ()

However, sdb's 'step over line' and 'step into line' commands called
'StepLine()' and 'NextLine()' respectively, hence a straight switch
was needed

'StepInstruction/NextInstruction' usage needed the same correction
