-don't initialise 'with_lispdir' unless the 'compute-lispdir' script is
successful
-hint to the user why the default 'datarootdir' based target changed

-issue hit if local sitepath set in .emacs. the 'compute-lispdir' script 
draws a blank, and so the install-lisp LISP target installs the files to
themselves?!
-ensuring the local sitepath exists in EMACSLOADPATH is an alternative 
work around

# autoreconf,.don't.force.update.diff [git sha:d78e3bb3c33d23990b2385bc57e1cac99b47a372 | committed]

-the use of autoreconf's '-f, --force consider all files obsolete' flag 
seems at odds with use of an old version of 'elisp-comp'. the resulting 
modifications to the file appear harmless but it causes the repo to have 
a modified status which gets in the way of further (git pull) updates

-note: for comparison, emacs-dbgr's autogen.sh call to autoreconf doesn't 
force obsolete status on all files
