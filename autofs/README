Added a trivial token length check to ensure the 'strictatime'
mount option is not consumed by string logic for the 'strict'
automount option.

Pre-patch, adding the 'strictatime' to a map effectively switched
strict mode (for multi-mount handling) on, and failed to pass the
'strictatime' option through to 'mount'.

This will have been an issue since 'strictatime' was introduced
for the 2.6.30 kernel.
