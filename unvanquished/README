# fix_.don't.access.profile.properties.prematurely.diff [git sha:1c6c7f9d568fd93bafd30355bdf98ec6c3a9312b | committed]

-on trying to create a new profile (running the daemon and hitting
'create profile' i hit a black screen, and then ended up at the same 
initial menu

-this was caused by leaving the profile name empty, but there was no
error message stating that a profile name is required

-internally, 'com_errorMessage' was getting cleared following a
'com_Error'/server reset, caused by accessing the non-existant profile
name in the 'createProfile' switch

-this commit ensure the missing error message is displayed correctly
